## What This Project Is

This is not a formal academic study. Instead, it’s a fun and informal project that gathers observations from everyday life where increasing input doesn't always mean increasing output.

For example:
> A student in engineering school might experience high energy and enthusiasm in the early years, but by the final year, the effort invested brings much less return — a light-hearted but clear case of diminishing returns.
